"""
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix.
You must do it in place.

Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

Constraints:
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[0].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1
