# Depth First Search Algorithms in Graph(DFS)
1. is mainly used to 
    1. Traverse all vertices in a “graph”;
    2. Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a “graph”
2. Implement: Stack(First In Last Out, Last In First Out) & Recursive call(Recursive Stack)

# When to use DFS:
## 1. All the solutions/path
## 2. The longest path
