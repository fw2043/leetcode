# Depth First Search Algorithms in Graph(DFS)
1. is mainly used to 
    1. Traverse all vertices in a “graph”;
    2. Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a “graph”
    3. THe longest path
2. Implement: Stack(First In Last Out, Last In First Out) & Recursive call(Recursive Stack)
3. Time complexity: O(V + E),  We need to check every vertex and traverse through every edge in the graph.
4. Space complexity: O(V)
